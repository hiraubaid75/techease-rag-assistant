The 14-day period starts on the date of first payment.
Refunds apply to monthly and annual plans unless stated otherwise at purchase.
To request a refund, contact support with your account email and the payment reference.
Refund requests are reviewed within 2 business days.
Approved refunds are returned to the original payment method.
Processing time is typically 5–10 business days depending on the bank.
Refunds are not provided after 14 days except where required by local law.
If your account was suspended for policy violations, refunds may be denied.
You can cancel anytime to stop future billing even if you are not eligible for a refund.
