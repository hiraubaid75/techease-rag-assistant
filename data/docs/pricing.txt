TechEase has three plans: Starter, Pro, and Enterprise.
Starter is designed for individuals and small teams with basic features.
Pro includes advanced analytics, team collaboration, and higher usage limits.
Enterprise includes SSO, custom roles, dedicated support, and enterprise security controls.
Annual billing provides a discount compared to monthly billing.
Enterprise pricing is custom and depends on the number of users and required integrations.
A free trial may be available for the Starter or Pro plan depending on promotions.
Invoices and receipts can be downloaded from the Billing section in the dashboard.
Taxes may apply depending on your country and will appear at checkout.
If you upgrade mid-cycle, TechEase prorates the remaining time on your current plan.
